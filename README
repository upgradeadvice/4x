	of this writing, whereas many other themes run into the hundreds of megs

Notice

	If you want a bug fixed, put it here: http://github.com/fuzion/4x/issues
    4x currently works with FoFiX on Python 2.7. Other binary files may be provided upon request.

Shouts

	Thanks to the FoFiX team for all of their work and patience.

Compiling
	
	Install Cython
	cd \fofix\data\themes\4x
	python setup.py build_ext
	
	Binary .pyd's are provided for Python 2.7 win32. You'll need to run the above command to compile for another platform.

Optional

1. Temporary Vocal Rockmeter Fix

	If you use a mic, you'll need to replace the various rockmeter.ini files 
	with their vocal compatible versions from the optional folder. These 
	won't show your score while playing. This will be fixed later.


2. 3D Notes

	If you have issues with stuttering or song intro lag, try using the optional\sq_notes instead.


4. Shader Tails (RB2 Mode)
	
	Copy the contents of optional/RB2 Mode to the root folder to enable shader tails. This will enable RB2 mode and disable starpower shaders.
