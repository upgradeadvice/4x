## Envy

    Envy is a very green branch of 4x. It has the same features as 4x, but 
    with many new and updated elements. 


## About 4x

	4x aims to become the new baseline for FoFiX 4.0 theme releases. It's 
	the first theme available that contains fully functional CustomTheme, 
	CustomLobby, CustomSetlist, and CustomParts modules. 

	4x also aims to be fast and lightweight. It is approx. 16MB at the time
	of this writing, whereas many other themes run into the hundreds of megs
