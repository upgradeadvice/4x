## About 4x

	4x aims to become the new baseline for FoFiX 4.0 theme releases. It's 
	the first theme available that contains fully functional CustomTheme, 
	CustomLobby, CustomSetlist, and CustomParts modules. 

	4x also aims to be fast and lightweight. It is approx. 16MB at the time
	of this writing, whereas many other themes run into the hundreds of megs

## Screenshots

	You can see screenshots of the theme in action here:

## Notice

	If you want a bug fixed, put it here: http://github.com/fuzion/4x/issues
    4x currently works with FoFiX on Python 2.7. Other binary files may be provided upon request.
